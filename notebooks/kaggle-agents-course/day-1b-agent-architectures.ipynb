The `SequentialAgent` and `ParallelAgent` produce their final output and then stop. This 'one-shot' approach isn't good for tasks that require refinement and quality control. What if the first draft of our story is bad? We have no way to review it and ask for a rewrite.\n\n**The Solution: Iterative Refinement**\n\nWhen a task needs to be improved through cycles of feedback and revision, you can use a `LoopAgent`. A `LoopAgent` runs a set of sub-agents repeatedly *until a specific condition is met or a maximum number of iterations is reached.* This creates a refinement cycle, allowing the agent system to improve its own work over and over.\n\n**Use Loop when:** Iterative improvement is needed, quality refinement matters, or you need repeated cycles.\n\nTo learn more, check out the documentation related to [loop agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/loop-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Story Writing & Critique Loop**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    A[\"Initial Prompt\"] -- > B[\"Writer Agent\"]\n    B -- >|story| C[\"Critic Agent\"]\n    C -- >|critique| D{\"Iteration < Max<br>AND<br>Not Approved?\"}\n    D -- >|Yes| B\n    D -- >|No| E[\"Final Story\"]\n\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style C fill:#ffcccc\n    style D fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"250\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day1/loop-agent.png\" alt=\"Loop Agent\" />","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 5.1 Example: Iterative Story Refinement\n\nLet's build a system with two agents:\n\n1. **Writer Agent** - Writes a draft of a short story\n2. **Critic Agent** - Reviews and critiques the short story to suggest improvements","metadata":{"id":"fP4I3mvtBtHF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent runs ONCE at the beginning to create the first draft.\ninitial_writer_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"InitialWriterAgent\",\n    model=\"gemini-2.5-flash-lite\",\n    instruction=\"\"\"Based on the user's prompt, write the first draft of a short story (around 100-150 words).\n    Output only the story text, with no introduction or explanation.\"\"\",\n    output_key=\"current_story\", # Stores the first draft in the state.\n)\n\nprint(\"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\")","metadata":{"id":"a2b8WlJoBtHF","outputId":"13ed1e15-dcf9-4e1d-ad1e-fb18ee793de5","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-10T01:07:52.632470Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-10T01:07:52.633337Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-10T01:07:52.638775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-10T01:07:52.633308Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-10T01:07:52.637583Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"✅ initial_writer_agent created.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This agent's only job is to provide feedback or the approval signal.

The foghorn moaned its mournful song, a constant companion in his isolated life. Tonight, however, was different. A peculiar glint caught his eye, not from the sea, but from a dusty corner of the keeper’s cottage.\n\nHe’d been tidying a forgotten sea chest, a relic of a long-dead predecessor. Beneath a tangle of brittle rope, a rolled parchment lay hidden. As Elias unfurled it, a soft, ethereal luminescence pulsed from within. It wasn't ink on vellum; it was light itself, coalescing into strange, swirling lines and symbols he’d never seen before. A map, he realized, but of no place he knew. It glowed with an inner fire, hinting at secrets buried far beyond the reach of any ship's lamp. The foghorn's cry seemed to deepen, as if acknowledging the sudden presence of the unknown.\nCriticAgent > The plot begins intriguingly with the discovery of a mystical map, setting up immediate mystery. However, the pacing is a bit rushed in the revelation of the map. We jump from Elias tidying to him unfurling a glowing map almost instantaneously. While the character of Elias is established as a solitary lighthouse keeper through his actions and environment, his internal reaction to the extraordinary map is only hinted at with the foghorn's cry. To improve this, consider expanding on Elias's reaction to the glowing map and developing his character further.\n\nHere are 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement:\n\n1.  **Deepen Elias's Reaction:** Instead of just mentioning the foghorn's cry deepening, show Elias's immediate, visceral reaction. Is he startled? Awed? Frightened? Does his hand tremble as he holds the glowing parchment? Describe his thoughts or feelings as he tries to comprehend what he's seeing. This will make Elias a more relatable and engaging character.\n\n2.  **Slow Down the Revelation:** Spend a little more time on the discovery of the map. Elias is \"tidying a forgotten sea chest.\" What does he find first? Perhaps he uncovers a false bottom, or the parchment is wedged in a peculiar way. Describe the physical sensation of the parchment – is it warm, cool, crackling with energy? This build-up can increase the suspense and impact of the map's glowing reveal.\n\n3.  **Hint at the Map's Nature:** The description of the map is good, but it could be more specific. What kind of \"strange, swirling lines and symbols\" are they? Do they resemble constellations, currents, or something more abstract and alien? Even a brief, evocative detail about the map's appearance could further intrigue the reader and hint at the nature of the secrets it holds.\nRefinerAgent > Elias polished the great Fresnel lens, its beam cutting a steady swathe through the encroaching fog. The salt spray was a familiar kiss on his weathered cheeks, the rhythmic sigh of the waves a constant lullaby. His life was one of quiet solitude, punctuated only by the mournful moan of the foghorn, a sound that had become as ingrained in him as his own heartbeat. Tonight, however, a subtle shift in the air, an almost imperceptible hum beneath the usual symphony of the sea, hinted at a deviation from his predictable existence.\n\nWhile attempting to organize the detritus of his solitary life, his attention was snagged by a peculiar glint emanating from a dusty sea chest tucked away in a forgotten corner of the keeper’s cottage. It was a relic, heavy with the scent of brine and decay, a silent testament to a predecessor long since claimed by the sea. As Elias wrestled with the stubborn latch, a faint warmth radiated from within. He pried open the lid, the hinges groaning in protest, revealing a jumble of brittle rope and faded charts. His fingers, calloused from years of service, brushed against something unexpected – a rolled parchment, strangely pliable despite its aged appearance.\n\nCuriosity overriding his usual methodical nature, Elias carefully unfurled it. A collective gasp escaped his lips as a soft, ethereal luminescence bloomed from the parchment, pushing back the dim cottage light. His breath hitched. It wasn't ink on vellum; it was pure, unadulterated light, coalescing into intricate, swirling lines and symbols that defied any cartographical knowledge he possessed. They pulsed with an inner fire, shifting like liquid constellations. Some resembled no stars he knew, while others seemed to trace the phantom currents of an unseen ocean, or perhaps, pathways through realms unknown. His hands, usually steady as the lighthouse beam itself, trembled. Awe warred with a primal sense of unease. Was this a map? If so, of what world, what impossible sea? The foghorn's cry, usually a comforting, albeit somber, presence, seemed to deepen, its resonating bellow echoing Elias's own burgeoning sense of wonder and trepidation, as if the very lighthouse acknowledged the sudden, profound intrusion of the unknown into its lonely vigil.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

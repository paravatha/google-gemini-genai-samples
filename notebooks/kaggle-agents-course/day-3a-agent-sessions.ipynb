Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is having a profound and rapidly accelerating impact. There are many exciting new developments, and here are some of the key ones:\n\n**1. AI for De Novo Drug Design (Designing New Molecules):**\n\n*   **Generative AI Models:** This is a huge area. Instead of just searching existing databases, AI models (like Variational Autoencoders - VAEs, Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs, and increasingly, transformer-based models) are now capable of *designing entirely new molecular structures* with desired properties.\n    *   **Example:** Companies are using these models to generate molecules that are predicted to bind to specific disease targets, have good absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) properties, and minimal toxicity.\n*   **Targeted Generation:** These models can be guided by specific constraints, such as targeting a particular protein or pathway, or avoiding certain off-target interactions.\n\n**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Leveraging Multi-omics Data:** AI can integrate and analyze vast amounts of data from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics to identify novel disease targets that might have been missed by traditional methods.\n*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI is being used to assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be \"druggable\" – meaning, can a molecule be designed to effectively interact with it.\n\n**3. Accelerating Preclinical Development:**\n\n*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** AI models are becoming more sophisticated at predicting how a drug candidate will perform *in vitro* (in lab tests) and *in vivo* (in animal models) before costly and time-consuming experiments are conducted. This helps to:\n    *   **Prioritize Promising Candidates:** Focus resources on molecules with the highest likelihood of success.\n    *   **Identify Potential Issues Early:** Flag molecules with predicted toxicity or lack of efficacy, saving resources and time.\n*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** AI can help chemists refine initial \"lead\" compounds to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.\n\n**4. Improving Clinical Trial Design and Execution:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can identify specific patient subgroups who are most likely to respond to a particular drug, leading to more efficient and successful clinical trials.\n*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can analyze historical trial data to predict the likelihood of success for new trials, helping to optimize trial design and resource allocation.\n*   **Synthetic Control Arms:** In some cases, AI is being explored to create \"synthetic control arms\" for clinical trials, reducing the need for large placebo groups, especially in rare diseases.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses for Old Drugs:** AI can analyze vast databases of drug properties, disease mechanisms, and patient data to identify existing approved drugs that might be effective for new indications. This is a much faster and often safer route to new treatments than developing entirely new molecules.\n\n**Notable AI-driven Drug Discovery Companies & Trends:**\n\n*   **Insilico Medicine:** Known for its AI-powered platform for drug discovery and development, they have advanced several AI-discovered drugs into clinical trials.\n*   **Exscientia:** A leader in AI-driven drug design, they have successfully partnered with major pharmaceutical companies and have drugs in clinical development.\n*   **Atomwise:** Uses deep learning for structure-based drug discovery.\n*   **Recursion Pharmaceuticals:** Leverages AI and machine learning to analyze cellular images and discover new drug candidates.\n*   **Schrödinger:** While not solely an AI company, they are a leader in physics-based computational chemistry and are integrating AI to enhance their drug discovery capabilities.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on. Ensuring high-quality, diverse, and accessible datasets is crucial.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation, which remains a bottleneck.\n*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** Gaining regulatory approval for AI-discovered and designed drugs is an ongoing process.\n*   **Integration into Workflow:** Effectively integrating AI tools into the complex workflows of traditional pharmaceutical research and development.\n\nIn conclusion, AI is not just a buzzword in drug discovery; it's a transformative technology that is fundamentally changing how new medicines are found, designed, and developed. We are seeing a significant increase in the speed and efficiency of the drug discovery pipeline, with the potential to bring life-saving treatments to patients much faster.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the second development I mentioned, which was **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**. This is a critical foundational step in drug discovery, and AI is bringing significant innovation here.\n\nLet me elaborate on what this means and how AI is being applied:\n\n**What is a Drug Target?**\n\nBefore we dive into AI, it's important to understand what a \"drug target\" is. In the context of treating a disease, a drug target is typically a specific molecule within the body (like a protein, enzyme, receptor, or even a gene) that plays a crucial role in the disease process.\n\n*   **The Goal:** The idea is to design a drug that can interact with this target – either activating it, inhibiting it, or modifying its function – to correct the underlying problem causing the disease.\n\n**Why is Target Identification and Validation Challenging?**\n\nIdentifying the *right* target is incredibly difficult for several reasons:\n\n*   **Complexity of Biological Systems:** The human body is an incredibly complex network of interacting molecules and pathways. A single disease can be influenced by multiple targets, and a single target can be involved in several different biological processes (leading to potential side effects).\n*   **Vast Amounts of Data:** Researchers generate enormous amounts of biological data from various sources (as mentioned before: genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, etc.). Making sense of this data and pinpointing causal relationships to disease is a monumental task.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Even when a target is identified, it might be difficult to design a drug that can effectively bind to it and modulate its activity.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at finding patterns and making predictions within massive, complex datasets. Here's how it's being applied:\n\n1.  **Integration of Multi-omics Data:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Traditionally, researchers might focus on one type of data (e.g., just genomics). However, understanding a disease often requires looking at how genes are expressed (transcriptomics), what proteins are being produced (proteomics), and what metabolic pathways are active (metabolomics). These layers of information are interconnected.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI algorithms can seamlessly integrate these disparate data types. They can identify subtle correlations between genetic mutations, protein levels, and metabolic changes that are associated with a specific disease.\n    *   **Example:** An AI model might notice that a particular genetic mutation (genomics) is consistently linked to an overproduction of a specific protein (proteomics) in diseased cells, and this protein is found in elevated levels in key metabolic pathways (metabolomics). This points to a potential target.\n\n2.  **Network Analysis and Pathway Mapping:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Diseases often don't stem from a single faulty molecule but from disruptions in complex biological networks or pathways.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI can build sophisticated models of these biological networks. By analyzing how different molecules interact, AI can identify key \"bottlenecks\" or \"hubs\" within these networks that, if targeted, could have a significant impact on the disease.\n    *   **Example:** AI can map out the signaling cascade involved in cancer cell growth and identify a crucial enzyme in that pathway that, when inhibited, can effectively shut down the entire process.\n\n3.  **Predicting Target Druggability:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** As mentioned, not all identified targets are amenable to drug development.\n    *   **AI's Role:** AI models can be trained on data from known drug targets and their success rates. These models can then predict the \"druggability\" of new potential targets based on their structural characteristics, binding sites, and interactions with other molecules.\n    *   **Example:** An AI might analyze the 3D structure of a newly identified protein target and predict that its binding pocket is too shallow or too flexible to allow a small molecule drug to bind effectively and stably.\n\n4.  **Identifying Novel Disease Mechanisms:**\n    *   **The Challenge:** Sometimes, the underlying cause of a disease is not well understood.\n    *   **AI's Role:** By analyzing large-scale patient data, AI can uncover previously unknown associations between certain biological markers and disease progression, thus revealing new disease mechanisms that can then point to novel therapeutic targets.\n    *   **Example:** AI might identify a correlation between a specific type of gut microbiome composition and the development of an autoimmune disease, suggesting that targeting the microbiome or its products could be a new therapeutic strategy.\n\n**In essence, AI acts as an intelligent curator and analyst for the overwhelming amount of biological information available.** It helps researchers move beyond simply observing data to actively discovering and prioritizing the most promising targets for drug development. This significantly reduces the time and resources needed to find the starting point for developing new therapies.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Several types of companies are heavily involved in using AI for target identification and validation, ranging from large pharmaceutical giants to specialized AI drug discovery startups.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.

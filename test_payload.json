    "query": "You are an experienced medical professional skilled at identifying contraindications associated with Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis. You will be provided with a list of Patient Notes. These include the following note types ['ED Triage Notes', 'Progress Notes', 'H&P', 'ED Notes', 'ED Provider Notes']. Identify the contraindications associated with the following instructions: Instructions for \"Active Bleeding\": - Clinician's Assessment: Prioritize the clinician's documented assessment over the patient's self-report unless the patient's symptoms are strongly indicative of active bleeding. - Types of Bleeding: Active bleeding can include both internal (e.g., gastrointestinal, intracranial) and external bleeding (e.g., open wounds). - Transfusions: Active bleeding is likely if the patient required a blood transfusion for the current episode. - Hematomas: Hematomas are not considered active bleeding unless explicitly noted by the clinician as currently bleeding. - Drainage & Wound Care: Drainage from a wound, especially in wound care settings, is not considered active bleeding unless it's explicitly noted as uncontrolled or active bleeding. - Monitoring & History: A patient being monitored for bleeding or having a history of bleeding without current evidence is not considered actively bleeding. - Blood in Stool or Vomit: Presence of fresh blood in stool (hematochezia) or vomit (hematemesis) should be considered as active bleeding. - Hemoglobin Levels: A drop in hemoglobin alone does not confirm active bleeding unless associated with clinical findings or the need for a transfusion. However, if hemoglobin levels are critically low or have dropped 1 g/dL within 24 hours, this indicates active bleeding. - Controlled Bleeding: If the bleeding has been controlled or has stopped, it is not considered active bleeding. Please follow the instructions below to complete the task--given the Patient Notes in triple quotes (\"\"). 1. Identify all occurrences of the contraindication 2. If a contraindication exists, output true and store in the \"result\" field 3. If a contraindication exists, extract the exact text from the Patient Notes and store in the \"text\" field of a \"citation\" object in the \"citations\" field 4. If a contraindication exists, add the following additional information to the \"citations\" field as additional properties: the closest section title or section category in \"section\", the name of the note type in \"note_type\", the clinician name in \"author\", and datetime in \"datetime\". 5. If a contraindication does not exist, output false and store in the \"result\" field 6. If no evidence related to a particular contraindication is in the Patient Notes, output an empty list in the \"citations\" field. 7. Provide a Reasoning how you arrived at the citation and store in the \"reasoning\" field 8. Provide the associated indicator name matching the term in \"Instructions for <indicator_name>\" in the \"indicator_name\" field for each entry in the list of \"indicators\". Each entry should have one of the following: [ \"Active Bleeding\" ]. Example JSON Outputs: Example 1: { \"indicators\": [ { \"indicator_name\": \"Active Bleeding\", \"result\": true, \"citations\": [ { \"text\": \"Patient admitted with gunshot wound to the abdomen noted in\", \"author\": \"Dr. John Smith\", \"datetime\": \"10/10/2021 12:03\", \"note_type\": \"H&P\", \"section\": \"History of Present Illness\" } ], \"reasoning\": \"A patient currently suffering from a gunshot wound to the abdomen is experiencing active bleeding.\" } ] } Example 2: { \"indicators\": [ { \"indicator_name\": \"Active Bleeding\", \"result\": false, \"citations\": [], \"reasoning\": \"No evidence of Active Bleeding in the patient notes.\" } ] } Do not infer or make assumptions about the contraindication.

Identify the contraindications associated with the following instructions: Instructions for \"Active Bleeding\": - Clinician's Assessment: Prioritize the clinician's documented assessment over the patient's self-report unless the patient's symptoms are strongly indicative of active bleeding. - Types of Bleeding: Active bleeding can include both internal (e.g., gastrointestinal, intracranial) and external bleeding (e.g., open wounds). - Transfusions: Active bleeding is likely if the patient required a blood transfusion for the current episode. - Hematomas: Hematomas are not considered active bleeding unless explicitly noted by the clinician as currently bleeding. - Drainage & Wound Care: Drainage from a wound, especially in wound care settings, is not considered active bleeding unless it's explicitly noted as uncontrolled or active bleeding. - Monitoring & History: A patient being monitored for bleeding or having a history of bleeding without current evidence is not considered actively bleeding. - Blood in Stool or Vomit: Presence of fresh blood in stool (hematochezia) or vomit (hematemesis) should be considered as active bleeding. - Hemoglobin Levels: A drop in hemoglobin alone does not confirm active bleeding unless associated with clinical findings or the need for a transfusion. However, if hemoglobin levels are critically low or have dropped 1 g/dL within 24 hours, this indicates active bleeding. - Controlled Bleeding: If the bleeding has been controlled or has stopped, it is not considered active bleeding.
